# Overview
This project presents a prototype system comprised of three subsystems with the intentionof reducing traffic accidents. The first two revolve around the detection of traffic violations with  the  use  of  real-time  object  detection  and  intention  aware  risk  estimation.   The purpose of the third subsystem is to detach personal information from the data gathered by  the  previously  mentioned  subsystems.   This  makes  it  possible  to  use  the  data  to pinpoint problematic areas in a traffic environment.
